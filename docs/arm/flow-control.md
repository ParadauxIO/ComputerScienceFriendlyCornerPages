# Flow Control

Flow control is the process of controlling how your programme executes. This is done by testing conditions and moving the programme counter respectively. There are 3 primary forms of flow control:

-   If statements 
-   While loops (including do-while)
-   For loops

There are other forms of these loops that you will find in higher-level languages however due to it being difficult to translate into Assembly Language. 

## If statements

If statements are made up of a condition and a body. The body of the statement only executes if the condition is true. 

```pseudocode
x = 5 + 6;
if (x >= 11) {
	print ("X is greater than or equal to 11!");
}
```

The example above shows a typical for loop in a high-level language such as C, Javascript or Java. It contains a condition, which should render down into a Boolean expression (in this case whether or not our variable x is greater than or equal to 11) 

We can have more complicated conditions however, using logical operators. 

```pseudocode
if (x >= 3 || x >= 10) {}
if (x == false && y == true) {}
if ((X && Y) || Z) {}
```

These are accomplished by combining our simple conditions with logical operators, we're only going to be dealing with OR and AND in this particular example.

| \|\|   | Logical OR. Tests if the statement on the left OR the statement on the right is true, if so it is true. |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **&&** | **Logical AND. Tests if the statement on the left AND the statement on the right is true, if so it is true.** |

If statements are a logical conclusion to the instructions we have at our disposal in arm assembly. We can construct a simple if statement, similar to the first example above as follows: 

```assembly
Main:
	CMP     Rx, Ry			@ if (x <= y)
	BGT     XGreaterThanY    @ Branch on the opposite condition (>)
	ADD     Rx, Rx, #1
	[...]
XGreaterThanY:
	[...]

End_Main:
```

As you can see above we always branch on the opposite **condition** what this means is that we jump to a later point in our code IF and only IF the condition was the opposite to that we expected, in our case if X was greater than Y (we were testing if it was less than or equal to) `[...]` is just a stand-in for other code your programme may be executing outside the bounds of the examples provided.

## If-else

```assembly
Main:
	CMP     Rx, Ry			  @ If (x < y)
	BHS     XHigherOrEqualToY  @ Branch on the opposite condition (>=)
	MOV     Rz, Rx             @ z = x
	B       EndIf              @ End the if statement
	[...]
XHigherOrEqualToY:
	MOV Rx, Ry                 @ z = y
	[...]
EndIf:
	[...]

End_Main:
	
```

The above assembly-language code is based on this pseudo-code

```pseudocode
if (x < y) {
	z = x;
} else {
	z = y;
}
```

## If - elseif - else 

```assembly
Main:
    CMP R1, #10       @ v < 10
    BHS IfPt2

    MOV R0, #1
    b End_Main
IfPt2:
    CMP R1, #100      @ v < 100
    BHS IfPt3

    MOV R0, #10
    b End_Main
IfPt3:              
    CMP R1, #1000     @ v < 1000
    BHS Else

    MOV R0, #100
    b End_Main
  Else:               @ If none of the above are true
    MOV R0, #0
   
End_Main:
```

Which is a translation of the below pseudocode 

```pseudocode
if (v < 10) {
  a = 1;
} else if (v < 100) {
  a = 10;
} else if (v < 1000) {
  a = 100;
} else {
  a = 0;
}  
```

## If AND

```assembly
Main:
	  CMP R0, #'A'
  	  BLO End_Main
  	  
      CMP R0, #'Z'
      BHI End_Main
      
      ADD R0, R0, #0x20
End_Main:
```

```pseudocode
if (ch >= 'A' && ch <= 'Z') {
  ch = ch + 0x20;
}
```

## If OR

```assembly
Main:
  CMP R1, #'a'
  BEQ StatementWasTrue
  CMP R1, #'e'
  BEQ StatementWasTrue
  CMP R1, #'i'
  BEQ StatementWasTrue
  CMP R1, #'o'
  BEQ StatementWasTrue
  CMP R1, #'u'
  BEQ StatementWasTrue
  
  @ Statement was false if it reached this point without branching.

  MOV R0, #0
  b End_Main 			@ Go to the end so we don't execute our true body

StatementWasTrue:
  MOV R0, 1
 
End_Main:
```

```pseudocode
if (ch=='a' || ch=='e' || ch=='i' || ch=='o' || ch=='u'){
 v = 1;
} else {
 v = 0;
}
```

# LOOPS

Loops are bodies of code which are repeated. There are two primary forms of loops I'll be looking at:

-   While loops
-   For loops

## While Loop

The while loop is the "if statement" of loops. It contains a simple condition check, which WHILE true will repeat the body of code below it.

```pseudocode
while (true) {
	print("Hello, World!");
}
```

This loop will repeat forever, as there is no way true would ever be false. This is known as an `infinite` loop and are usually to be avoided. 

We can create the above loop very simply. 

```assembly
Main:

WhileTrue:
	[...]
	
	b WhileTrue
```

Any code placed in that loop will be repeated continuously, forever. This is because we are *unconditionally* branching back to the top of the loop after each execution.

We can place a condition at the start or at the end, placing the condition check at the end will ensure that the code is executed at least once, this is usually referred to as a `do-while` loop 

```pseudocode
x = 0;
do {
  print("Hello, World");
} while (x < 5);
```

```assembly
Main:
	LDR R0, =0
Do:
	[...] @ Print or whatever you like
	
	CMP R0, #5
	BHS EndLoop
	b Do
EndLoop:

End_Main:
```

or a traditional while-loop equivilent

```assembly
Main:
	LDR R0, =0
Do:
	CMP R0, #5
	BHS EndLoop
	
	[...] @ Print or whatever you like
	
	b Do
EndLoop:

End_Main:

```

```pseudocode
while (x < 5) {
	print("Hello, World!")
}
```

There is, however an issue with both of those loops, at no point do we update the value of x inside the loop, thus they will continue to execute forever, which is most likely an unwanted conclusion. 

To solve this we need to increment (increase by) x by a value on each iteration (each time the body is executed)

```assembly
Main:
	LDR R0, =0
Do:
	CMP R0, #5
	BHS EndLoop
	
	[...] @ Print or whatever you like
	
	ADD R0, R0, #1
	b Do
EndLoop:

End_Main:
```
