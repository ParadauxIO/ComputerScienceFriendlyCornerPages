# Unit Testing

Unit testing is the process of automatically testing small portions of your code; usually classes, methods and constructors. 

Unit testing is an incredibly important topic in Industry development to ensure that broken code isn't pushed into production! The reason you would test your code is to prove to yourself, and perhaps to the users / clients / customers,    that your code works, in a concrete manor; think of it like proving from first principals in mathematics. 

Unit tests are typically automated, meaning once they are implemented, you can run them again and again, usually every time before the project is compiled, that way the build can be aborted or marked as failed should the tests fail. 

Some people devote their entire SWE Career to Unit testing in a field referred to as Quality Assurance Engineering. 

Modern Tools for unit testing include; The XUnit Family (See JUnit for Java), PIT Mutation, TestNG, Mockito and Selenium.

Unit testing is an integral part in the continuous integration / deployment process.
