This website is a list of various curated resources which will help you stay ahead of the curve when it comes to first year computer science. 

### Development State:

This website is still in early development, please report any issues faced with the website; including typos, grammar mistakes, insensitive language, programming mistakes, etc. Issues can be reported via the GitHub Repository for the project [here](https://github.com/ParadauxIO/ComputerScienceFriendlyCornerPages)


### Contributing

I (Rían) am not taking pure CS, so I would love if people were willing to submit markdown notes and resources for pure CS topics. You can find the github repository [here](https://github.com/ParadauxIO/ComputerScienceFriendlyCornerPages)

If you don't know how to use git, it's a planned tutorial
