# Welcome!

Welcome to the [Computer Science Friendly Corner](https://csfriendlycorner.com)!

This website is a list of various curated resources which will help you stay ahead of the curve when it comes to first year computer science including: 

-   Java Tutorials on basic principles (IntelliJ, Control Flow, OOP, Primitives etc)
-   Java Tutorials on various tools (JUnit, Maven/Gradle(Coming Soon!))
-   Pre-made assignment unit tests
-   Arm Assembly resources 

These resources are going to be added to almost nightly. Be sure to check back often! You can follow the websites development by taking a gander at the [master branch](https://github.com/ParadauxIO/ComputerScienceFriendlyCornerPages/tree/master)'s [commit history](https://github.com/ParadauxIO/ComputerScienceFriendlyCornerPages/commits/master)! These resources are provided by students willingly, and taken from personal notes to help you out!

### Contributing

I (RÃ­an) am not taking pure CS, so I would love if people were willing to submit markdown notes and resources for pure CS topics. You can find the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/ParadauxIO/ComputerScienceFriendlyCornerPages)

If you don't know how to use git, it's a planned tutorial
