# Discord Rules

These rules won't necessarily be kept up to date with the discord version. Make us aware of any contradicting information. 

1. **You are always expected to show respect to all fellow students and Trinity Staff.**
Any form of name-calling, drama-stirring and spreading of rumours will not be tolerated. Harassment and repeated targeted abuse of discord members is unacceptable and will be met with a permanent ban.

2. **Any issues regarding the server or its members must be brought up in private.**
If you have an issue with the server or one of its members report it to your class representative or by using the #mod-mail channel.

3. **Political and religious discussion is prohibited.**
It goes outside of the scope of this discord server, which aims to provide academic support to our fellow students and to facilitate intercommunication in computer science generally. These topics only cause division and discourage new people from joining in the conversation. 
**N.B** This rule does not have an effect in #political-discussion 

4. **Members may not use the discord to share pornography, gore and otherwise illicit content.**
Furthermore, any discussion of related material is prohibited. This includes topics such as piracy/copyright infringement.

5. **Discord members are expected to conduct themselves as if they were using an official College social medium.**
As such, all rules and regulations subject to those apply here. ** Please see the footnote on the discord server for more information. This includes condoning plagiarism.

6. **This platform is hosted on discord, as such, the discord terms of service must always be followed.**

**N.B** :: The Rules set is subject to change at any time. Staff members may act upon something which is not explicitly listed, moderators are trusted to act on their own discretion. If you have an issue with this, please use the #mod-mail feature or contact your class representative.
