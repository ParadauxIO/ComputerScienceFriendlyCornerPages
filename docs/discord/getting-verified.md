# Getting verified

The Computer Science Friendly Corner is configured so that everyone must verify their participating college email address to gain access.

If you are not a member of a participating college, you can also gain access by getting into contact with the moderators. 

## Verification Instructions

1. Enter your college email address into #verification
2. Check your email address for the verification code just sent to your email address
3. Enter the verification code just received back into the #verification channel

Once you've completed those steps you're a fully fledged member of the computer science friendly corner, and you can go ahead and claim additional roles in #role-selection 

Email Addresses are not stored, if you run into issues with verification contact the moderation team by using the mod-mail functionality. DO NOT send them your email address unless explicitly requested. Should that happen, all local copies of the email address will be deleted on your behalf immediately after use.
